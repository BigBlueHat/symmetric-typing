To try the solemak layout on Linux you can use the `xmodmap` definition in this
folder. Just try this command and keep your Solemak cheatsheet near you:

    $ xmodmap solemak.xmodmap

The solemak layout will last only for the current session, when you
will restart your computer you will have your usual layout.
